# Android Call Recorder

This project is an Android application built with Jetpack Compose that records phone calls. Note that due to restrictions in Android versions 9 (Pie) and 10 (Q), the application only records the side of the call that is making the call.

## Features

- Record phone calls
- Single-side recording (only records the caller's voice)
- Jetpack Compose for modern UI development

## Requirements

- Android 9 (Pie) or later
- Jetpack Compose 1.0 or later

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zuanid-Sutlan/android-call-recorder.git
